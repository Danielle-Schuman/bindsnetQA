Evaluation notes:
- clamping works that way that for every label, there is a specific group of neurons in 
layer Ae of which a random one gets clamped 
-> with 10 input-nodes, it's always the same one that gets clamped for a certain label
-> that's why learning is "deterministic" at this size 
-> doesn't really say a lot about learning quality

- parameters exc, inh: initial weights between layers Ae and Ai where there are connections (rest = 0): 
:param exc: Strength of synapse weights from excitatory to inhibitory layer.
:param inh: Strength of synapse weights from inhibitory to excitatory layer. -> weight is - inh

Changes to code?:
- Fig. 2C from Diehl&Cook-Paper is similar to our BindsNET performance plot -> maybe call it training accuracy?

Evaluation:
- with Parameters "--n_neurons 10 --n_train 100 --time 10 --update_interval 5" still deterministic (same for bindsnet and bindsnet_qa), at 100% accuracy after about 50 examples, qb_solv energies at time 3 = ca. -10 and at time 7 either -32.9 or -13 and sometimes at time 10 -28
- with Parameters "--n_neurons 20 --n_train 75 --time 10 --update_interval 5" not deterministic anymore; both BindsNET and BindsNETqa usually go up to between 80% and 100% quite quickly (until example 50 at most), but with quite some up- and downturns, and then stay there, turning up and down, until the end (75); BindsNETqa overall has very similar performance as BindsNET (although hard to tell because generally a lot of variability), maybe only has a little more up- and downturns than BindsNET, but not significantly, also, up- and downturns tend to be a little smaller, but not significantly; qb_solv energies stay pretty much the same as with 10 neurons
- Paramters "--n_neurons 30 --n_train 100 --time 10 --update_interval 5": Performance worse than with 20 neurons: more up- and downturns, takes longer until it reaches "good" accuracy (doesn't drop beneath 80% only after 80 examples); BindsNET and BindsNETQA again quite similar performance (BindsNETQA might have a little more, but smaller turns and might even reach higher percentages a tiny bit quicker and more stably); qb_solv energies about the same as with 20 neurons, although last non-zero value tends to be there a lot more often
- Parameter "--n_neurons 20 --n_train 100 --time 20 --update_interval 5", training works a lot (!) better than with --time 10: Curve generally doesn't drop below 80% anymore after example 50, often already reaches 100% at 30, goes up quite fast; performance of both BindsNET and BindsNETQA again very similar, QA seems to do a little worse in that it seems to take a on average a little bit longer to reach 100% for the first time and has a little more often that it drops back to 60% for one interval after 50 (usually curve stays between 80% and and 100% there, often stays at 100%); concerning qb_solv-energies, there are additional non-zero values at 14 and 18, the one at 3 is again about -10, the one at 7 again either -13 or -32, the one at 10 is always there now and is a little higher, -27 to -35), the one at 14 is again either -32 or -13 and the last one series between -30 and -40 (sometimes even peaking to -49, or down to -26), but tends to be lower when the ones before are lower, overall, the number are lower or higher "together"
- Parameters "--n_neurons 30 --n_train 100 --time 10 --update_interval 10": due to higher update interval, less up- and downturns→ overall performance easier to evaluate, as trends more clearly visible (e.g. most likely "difficult" images "at" 60, as often drop occurs there), performance very similar (doesn't drop below 80% after about 70 or 80 (here maybe little earlier)), but more steady (with smaller update_interval, we had big drops (to 60% -) varying with 100% in the second half, here, we only rarely reach 100%, but difference with drops not that big (mostly ≤ 20% at end)), end-performance might be little worse in comparison to smaller update_int (stays less at 100% in end, especially BindsNET); BindsNET and BindsNETQA again very comparable in performance (reach 50% after about 20 - 40 (often all at 20, proportion at 40 → ?!), don't drop below 80% after 70, never reaches stable 100% → could be useful to rerun this experiment with more training examples), but BindsnetQA seems to earlier reach 100% for the first time (often 50 already compared to BindsNets 70; BindsNET only reaches about 80% at 50), dropping to similar values as BindsNET again afterwards, and seems to stay at 100% at the end more often (although not enough data to be sure that it really stays there); qb_solv energies again the same, realised that a 0 at time 10 correlates with a -32 at time 7 and a non-zero value correlates with a -13
